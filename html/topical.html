                <p 1>The development of social media and chat services is relevant for studies within informations technology. Studies in this area provide competence to be able to develop website and apps witch we in this society use in everyday life</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="main text">
                <p 1>The technology is also developed in line with changes in society. According to a survey carried out by Global social media statics are we only unsing social media and chat services to communicate today, and not as much of the older methods such as letters (Chaffey 2022).</p>
                <br>
                <p 2>This technology is relevant for studies within IT, because it is constanly used to communcate and make gruop work more efficient. We all have differend routines and therefore contact contact through social meldia is an importan function to achieve good group work. Since you can easily share documents and tesks, as well discuss.</p>
                <br>
                <p 3>Knut Jørgen Vie expresses that changes in society's values ​​can affect the development of various technologies, and he highlights social media as an example. In the video, Vie says "this technology has had a significant impact on the social life for many people, but the values ​​these people hold are finding their way back into technology" (Oslomet, 2018-2020, 5:49).</p>
                <br>
                <p 4>Social media and chat services have evolved to become more complex and people who use these platforms have had their values ​​shaped. This is done by actively engaging with other people, for example family, friends or other students. As a society, we have thus defined social media as the "informal way" to seek out and keep in touch.</p>

                <br>
            <div class="end">
                <p 1>The development of social media and chat services has influenced the social norms in today's society. This is because we humans today communicate almost exclusively through social media. We are positive about the development since we as students can easily keep in touch with other students today.</p>
